<h3>1.Our Lttle Sister</h3>
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4b/Our_Little_Sister_poster.jpeg" />
<p>Director: Hirokazu Koreeda<br />
Release Year:Jul 8, 2016<br />
It is adapted by Koreeda from the manga Umimachi Diary by Akimi Yoshida.
Kore-eda seems so preoccupied with such small observations that the viewer 
may only gradually realize that time is passing and major events are taking place. 
That's the point, though, and beautifully illustrated.</p>

<h3>2.Only Yesterday</h3>

<p>Director: Hayao Miyazaki<br />
Release Year:20 July 1991<br />
Only Yesterday couldn't be more appropriately named. 
The intimate, spare drama from Hayao Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli first premiered in Japan in 1991, 
and in the 25 years since has somehow never seen an American release until now. 
But its familiar tale of finding your place in a fast-moving world feels like it could have
 been written last week, and together with forward-thinking direction</p>

<h3>3.Spirited Away</h3>

<p>Director: Hayao Miyazaki<br />
Release Year:20 July 2001<br />
In Spirited Away, one message holds itself above all others:
 never forget who you are. Yubaba controls her employees by stealing their names and 
 providing them with new ones. This act seems to make them forget their initial motivations in life, 
among other things, making them the perfect puppets for Yubaba to control.</p>
